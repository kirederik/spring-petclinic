Agenda:
- create a file called pipeline.yml
- define a build plan (pipeline) http://concourse.ci/build-plans.html
  - create a job to build the app
  - define a job plan
  - set the pipeline and show the box -- there are no actions yet
  - A job plan consists of a set of inputs and outputs, and sequence of tasks that can be executed on the inputs/outputs.
    - In concourse terminology: input and output are resources
    - A resource in something that is external to my pipeline but it's necessary to run
      - for example: a git repo, an s3 bucket or the "time"
      - to see the set of predefined resource types, check http://concourse.ci/resource-types.html
  - First, we need to clone the sprint petclinic from github
    - for that, we'll need to define a git resource that knows where to find the git repo
    - once we have the resource defined, we can make our job to "get" this resource
  - set pipeline: fly -t zumba set-pipeline -p spring-petclinic-ci -c ci/pipeline.yml
  - run the build job -- watch it go green
  - add trigger true to the "get" of the source code
  - create a new job called test and connect it after the build job
    - you can connect two jobs by using the "passed" keyword
  - create a new job called "code-analysis" to verify your code
  - create a job to deploy the app to CF
    - using the cf resource
    - with blue-green set to true -- so we have zero downtime
    - on success, notify on twitter that there is a new version of the app available
    - on failure, send notification on slack that deployment failed
  - create a new job to run regression tests against the just-deployed application
  - Briefly explain how Pivotal relies on github + tracker + concourse integration
    - Explain how one could do a similar thing with Jira, using the Jira Resource (https://github.com/danrspencer/jira-resource) for example
    - Note that one can easily implement one's own resource to extend concourse
  - wrap up
